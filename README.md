# dalle-clone
A full-stack project  built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project aims to create a clone of the popular OpenAI's DALL·E, an image generation model.


Key Features:

Text-to-Image Generation: Users can enter text prompts, and the system will generate corresponding images using the DALL·E-inspired model.
Interactive User Interface: The React.js front-end provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for entering text prompts and displaying generated images.
Seamless Backend Integration: The Node.js server, built with Express.js, handles user requests, processes text prompts, and communicates with the machine learning model to generate images.
Scalable Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store user data, including generated images and associated text prompts.
