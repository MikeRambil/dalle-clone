# dalle-clone

A full-stack project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project aims to create a clone of the popular OpenAI's DALL·E, an image generation model.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Users can enter text prompts, and the system will generate corresponding images using the DALL·E-inspired model.
- **Interactive User Interface**: The React.js front-end provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for entering text prompts and displaying generated images.
- **Seamless Backend Integration**: The Node.js server, built with Express.js, handles user requests, processes text prompts, and communicates with the machine learning model to generate images.
- **Scalable Database**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user data, including generated images and associated text prompts.
